# HPCC2022 POPNet

Source code for HPCC2022 accepted paper, ***A Glimpse of the Whole: Detecting Few-shot Android Malware Encrypted Network Traffic***

The project is written in Pytorch using the following backend: Intel i7-9750 @2.6GHz, 16GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce RTX2060; Windows 10, CUDA 10.1, and PyTorch 1.0.1.

## Data



Two datasets are Involved, including  MalDroid2017 and USTC2016.

**MalDroid2017** dataset. Download from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/andmal2017.html

**USTC2016** dataset. Download from https://github.com/yungshenglu/USTC-TFC2016

Toolkits are available at https://github.com/yungshenglu/USTC-TFC2016



Data folders are organized as follows:

Here, 42 classes of target data are stored in ```train```.  Aux classes are stored in ```backup_train```. Testing data of 42 classes of target data are stored in ```val-origin```.  USTC2016 for novelty testing is stored in ```val-ustc```.



## Evaluation



#### Few-shot Android Malware Encrypted Traffic Detection with Large-scale Classes

```python
# without auxiliary
python ./src_or/train.py  --cuda --classes_per_it_val 42   --epochs 100 --large_scale True

# with auxiliary
python ./src_aux/train.py  --cuda --classes_per_it_val 42   --epochs 100 --large_scale True
```



#### Zero-shot Learning on Cross-Platform Malware Traffic Detection

```python
# without auxiliary
python ./src_or/train.py  --cuda --classes_per_it_val 10   --epochs 100 --novelty_dec True

# with auxiliary
python ./src_aux/train.py  --cuda --classes_per_it_val 10   --epochs 100 --novelty_dec True
```



## Results

We compare our methods with state-of-the-art conventional detectors, including FlowPrint,  AppScanner, Datanet,   ACGAN, ACNN, LSTM, RBRN and FC-Net. In addition, state-of-the-art few-shot learning approaches are considered as baseline, including Prototypical Nets, Matching Nets, Triplet Nets, 5-Tuple Nets, MAML,  GNN and Relation Nets.
